# Java-practice
# this a practice in java where i have covered every concept in java
in order to run a java code you have to have the following
* JDK = java development kit - this has the jvm and the jre inside them
* JVM = Java virtual machine - this is where your code is running from
* JRE = Java Runtime Environment 

jvm has a stack memory which uses the first in first out method of executing code

# Naming Conventions
we have to use camel casing for best practices
classes - capital letters 
methods can be small letter tho if its two joined letter you should use camel casing
constants = fully capital letters
